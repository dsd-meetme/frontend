AngularJS project structure description:

app
	\shared   -> This folder will contain reusable elements for the angularJS application.
			         These elements are usually angularJS directives, but in some cases they can
			         be services that are used throughout the entire application

	\components -> AngularJS applications are single page applications so we have a master
				         page in which different pieces of html and all their related stuff are injected
				         based on the user's behavior. These pieces of html and all their related stuff(controllers
				         , specific services etc..) are put in subfolders of this components directives

	angular.module.js -> Configures and inits the application
	angular.routes.js  -> Defines the routes of the application

assets
	\css   -> Contains the css of the app
	\sass -> Contains the sass file for the app
		\components -> sass for app/components elements
		\shared -> sass for app/shared elements
		\global -> global styles
	\js     -> Javascript that is not angular related
	\libs  -> External libraries (Jquery, bootstrap, â€¦)

index.html -> the app entry point
